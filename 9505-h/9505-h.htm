    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Wait for T.O.," commanded Loraine, and of course they
      waited. Loraine's commands were always obeyed, Laura Ann
      said, because her name was such a <i>queeny</i> one. Nobody
      else in the little colony&#8212;the "B-Hive"&#8212;had a
      queeny name.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Though I just missed it," sighed Laura Ann. "Think what a
      little step from Loraine to Laur' Ann! I always just miss
      things."
    </p>
    <p>
      T.O. was apt to be late. She never rode, and, being short,
      was not a remarkable walker. To-night she was later than
      usual. The three other girls got into kimonos and slippers
      and prepared tea. In all their minds the Grand Plan was
      fomenting, and it was not easy to wait. A cheer greeted T.O.
      as she came in, wet and weary and cheerful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You're overdue, my dear," Loraine said severely. But of
      course T.O. laughed and offered a weak pun:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The 'dew' is over me, you mean! Oh, girls, this looks too
      cozy for anything in here! All the way up town I've been
      blessing you three for taking me in."
    </p>
    <p>
      Said Laura Ann: "If I were pun-mad, like some folks, I could
      do something quite smart there. But there, you poor, wet
      dear! You sha'n't be outdone in your specialty, no you
      sha'n't! Get off your things quick, dear&#8212;we're all
      bursting to talk about the Grand Plan."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, after all, Billy that started in. Billy was very
      tired indeed, and her lean, eager face was pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Girls, we <i>must!</i>" she said. "I can't hold out more
      than a few weeks more. I shall be a mental wreck and go
      'round muttering, <i>one</i>-two&#8212;three&#8212;four,
      <i>one</i>&#8212;two&#8212;three&#8212;four&#8212;flat your
      b's, sharp your
      c's&#8212;one&#8212;two&#8212;three&#8212;four&#8212;<i>play!</i>"
      For Billy all day toiled at pianos, teaching unwilling little
      persons to play. Billy's long name was Wilhelmina.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were all toilers&#8212;worker-B's. The "B" part of the
      name which they had given to the little colony came from the
      accident of all their surnames beginning with that
      letter&#8212;Brown, Bent, Baker, Byers. It was, they all
      agreed, a happy accident; the "B-Hive" sounded so well. But,
      as Laura Ann said, it entailed things, notably industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura Ann finished negatives part of the day to earn money to
      learn to paint the other part. She was poor, but the same
      good grit that made her loyal to her old grandmother's name,
      unshortened and unbeautified, gave her courage to work on
      toward the distant goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loraine taught&#8212;"just everlastingly taught," she said,
      until she could do it with her eyes shut. Cube root, all
      historic dates, all x, y, z's, were as printing to her,
      dinned into the warp and woof of her by patient reiteration.
      She was very tired, too. The rest of the long June days
      stretched ahead of her in weary perspective.
    </p>
    <p>
      That these three had drifted together in the great city was
      sufficiently curious, but more curious yet was the "drifting
      together" of T.O.&#8212;a plain little clerk in a great
      department store. She, herself, humbly acknowledged that she
      did not seem to "belong," but here she was, divesting herself
      of her wet wraps and getting ready for tea in the tiny flat.
      Handkerchiefs, initialed, "warranted,"&#8212;uninitialed,
      unwarranted&#8212;were behind her and ahead, but between she
      forgot their existence and took her comfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" she said presently. "I'm ready." They sat down to the
      simple little meal without further delay and with the first
      mouthfuls opened again the rather time-worn discussion. Could
      they adopt the Grand Plan? Oh, <i>couldn't</i> they? To get
      out of the hot, teeming city and breathe air enough and pure
      enough, to luxuriate in idleness, to <i>rest</i>&#8212;to a
      girl, they longed for it. They were all orphans, and they
      were all poor. The Grand Plan was ambitious, indefinite, but
      they could not give it up. They had wintered it and springed
      it, and clung to it through bright days and dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Loraine tapped sharply on the table. "All in favor
      of spending the summer in the country say 'aye,'" she cried,
      "and say it hard!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Aye!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Aye</i>!" appended Loraine, and said it hard. "It's a
      vote," she added calmly. Then, staring at each other, they
      sat for a little with rather frightened faces. For this thing
      that they had done was rather a stupendous thing. T.O.
      recovered first&#8212;courage was as the breath of her little
      lean nostrils.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Girls, this is great!" she laughed. "<i>We've gone and done
      it!</i> There's nothing left but to pack our trunks!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Except a few last trifles, such as deciding where to go and
      what to pay for it with," put in Laura Ann with soft irony.
      "We could decide those things on the train, I suppose&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let's decide 'em on the spot," rejoined T.O. imperturbably.
      "Somebody propose something."
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Billy was visited with one of her inspirations and
      promptly shared it with her usual generosity. "We must hunt
      up a place to&#8212;er&#8212;'bunk' in&#8212;just bunk and
      board ourselves. Of course we can't afford to <i>be</i>
      boarded&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course," in chorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, then, one of us must go out into the waste
      places&#8212;oh, anywhere where the grass has room to grow
      and there are trees and birds and <i>barns</i>&#8212;I
      stipulate barns." Billy made a splendid, comprehensive
      gesture that took in all the points of the compass
      impartially. "One of us must take a few days off and go and
      hunt up a nice, inexpensive little Eldorado for us.
      There!&#8212;there, my friends, you have the solution of your
      knotty little problem in a nutshell. I gladly give my
      'services' free."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who's going?" demanded practical Laura Ann. "Does anybody
      kindly volunteer?"
    </p>
    <p>
      No volunteers. Silence, broken only by the chirp of the
      cheery little teakettle. The immense responsibility of
      setting the Grand Plan in motion was not to be lightly
      assumed. The utter vagueness of Billy's "waste places" was
      dismaying, to say the least. There might be many nice,
      inexpensive little Eldorados waiting to be "bunked" in and
      picnicked in, but where? The world was full of places where
      there were trees and birds and barns, but to pick out the
      particular one where four tired-out young toilers could lay
      down their tools and rest <i>inexpensively</i>, looked like a
      big undertaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy had settled back in her chair with an air of having
      done her part and washed her hands of further responsibility.
      The rest must do their parts now. Billy, who was the youngest
      and frailest of the little colony of workers, had fallen into
      the way of dropping asleep whenever opportunity offered; she
      did so now with a little sigh of contentment. Her girlish
      face against the faded crimson back of the chair looked
      startlingly white. In her sleep she moved her lips and the
      others caught a pathetic little "<i>one</i>-two-three-four"
      dropping from them. Poor Billy! She was giving a music lesson
      in her dreams!
    </p>
    <p>
      Loraine made a little paper shade and shielded her pale face
      from the light, and Laura Ann tilted the clumsy patent rocker
      backward and trigged it with a book. Both their faces, tired,
      too, and pale, were sweet with kindness. T.O., who did queer
      and unexpected things, went round the table on her toes and
      kissed Billy's forehead openly. Her face had a puckering
      frown on it, oddly at variance with the kiss and with the
      look in her eyes. The kiss and the look were the things that
      mattered&#8212;the frown was a thing of insignificance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You poor little blessed!" she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Flat your b,'" murmured Billy wearily, and no one laughed.
      They were all laughers, but the picture of Billy toiling on
      monotonously in her sleep failed to appeal to them as
      humorous. T.O. went back silently to her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the initials T.O. stood for in the way of a name had
      been the subject of much guessing in the B-Hive, for the
      owner of the initials refused whimsically to explain them.
      Perhaps she would sometime when the moon was full or the wind
      was in the right quarter, she said. Meanwhile T.O. did well
      enough&#8212;as well as "Billy," anyway, or "Laura Ann"! And
      they fell in gayly with her whimsy and called her T.O. The
      nearest they had ever come to an answer to their guesses was
      one night when they had been discussing "talents" and
      comparing "callings," and T.O. had sat by, a wistful little
      listener and admirer. For T.O. had no talent, and who would
      call selling handkerchiefs from morning till night a
      "calling"? Even sheer, fine handkerchiefs, warranted every
      thread linen!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Talentless One," she broke out startlingly. "You want to
      know what 'T.O.' stands for&#8212;that's it!" And the amused
      look in the girls' eyes changed quickly to understanding at
      sight of her face. "Well," she challenged, "why don't you say
      what an appropriate name it is? It's a wonder you
      <i>talented</i> ones didn't guess it long ago! Listen!
      Loraine's talent is writing&#8212;we all know she'll be an
      author some day. Laura Ann's is art. Oh, you needn't
      laugh&#8212;need she, girls? One of these days we're all
      going to a 'hanging,' and <i>it'll be Laura Ann's!</i>
      Billy's talent everybody knows. She can play wicked folks
      good, if there's a piano handy. Well, what is my talent?
      Don't everybody speak at once!" The girl's flushed face
      defied them. It was bitter with longing to be a Talented One.

      "'YOU POOR LITTLE BLESSED!' SHE MURMURED.">
    </center>
    <p>
      "Dear!" It was like gentle Loraine to begin with a "dear,"
      and like her, too, to cross the room to T.O. and touch her
      little bitter face with cool fingers. "Dear, don't you
      worry&#8212;your talent is <i>there.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Where?" demanded T.O. Then she laughed. "I suppose you mean
      buried in a handkerchief! But I shall never be able to dig it
      out&#8212;never! There's such an awful pile of them on top!
      They keep piling on new ones every day. If I keep on selling
      handkerchiefs till I'm seventy-five, I'll never get down to
      my talent."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, after all, quite true, though none of them would
      acknowledge it&#8212;except the Talentless One herself. She
      was, as she insisted, the odd one in the busy little B-Hive.
      Her very face, small and dark and lean, was an "odd" one; the
      faces of the other three were marked by an indefinable
      something that she called talent, and she was not far wrong.
      A subtle refinement, intellectuality, asserted itself gently
      in all three of them. The dark little face of T.O. was
      vivacious and keen, but not refined or intellectual.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy was the baby "B," as Loraine was the acknowledged
      queen. They all favored Billy and took care of her. Was it a
      rainy morning? Somebody got Billy's rubbers, somebody else
      her umbrella! Was the child paler than usual? She must have
      the softest chair and be babied. Poor little toiler-Billy,
      created to have a mother and a home, to sit always in soft
      chairs and be taken care of! Yet without them all she was
      making a splendid struggle for independence, with the best of
      them, and they were conscious of a certain element of heroism
      in her toiling that none of the rest of them laid claim to in
      their own. The other B.'s were proud of Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      T.O. was as small and thin as Billy, but no one thought of
      taking care of T.O. or babying her. Instead, T.O.&#8212;the
      Talentless One&#8212;took care of them all. She had always
      been a toiler, always been alone, and to the rest it was
      comparatively a new experience. T.O., as she herself said,
      was able to give them all "points."
    </p>
    <p>
      While tired Billy slept to-night, the Grand Plan discussion
      was taken up again and entertained with new enthusiasm. It
      was now a definite Plan, since they had voted unanimously to
      adopt it&#8212;it was no longer merely a unanimous wish, to
      be bandied about longingly. It remained only to choose a
      brave soul to go forth and find for it a "local habitation."
    </p>
    <p>
      "When Billy wakes up, we'll draw lots," Loraine decided
      gently. "The one who gets the longest slip <i>will
      go</i>&#8212;but mercy! I hope I sha'n't be the one! Girls,
      there really ought to be one to&#8212;er&#8212;oversee the
      drawing of the lots&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hear! Hear!" from T.O.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You will take your chances with the common herd, my dear,"
      Laura Ann said firmly. "You really need not be alarmed,
      though, for I shall draw the fatal slip. I always do. Then I
      shall go up-country and engage four boards at a nice white
      house with green blinds, and forget to ask how much they will
      cost&#8212;the 'boards,' I mean&#8212;and whether they'll
      take Billy at half-price. You'll all like my white house, but
      you won't be able to stay more than one night on account of
      the expense. So you'll turn me out of the B-Hive and I
      shall&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, don't do anything else&#8212;don't!" T.O. groaned. "That
      will be doing enough."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We shall have to find a <i>very</i> cheap place," Loraine
      said, thoughtfully, too intent on the fate of the Grand Plan
      to listen to pleasantries. "Somewhere where it won't cost
      much of anything."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such an easy place to find!" murmured Laura Ann. "I see
      myself going straight to it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've <i>got</i> to go to it, on account of&#8212;" Loraine
      nodded toward the sleeping little figure in the softest
      chair. "Girls, Billy is all worn out."
    </p>
    <p>
      "So are you," Laura Ann said tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And you," retorted Loraine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Talentless One, unintentionally left out, sighed an
      infinitesimal sigh, preparatory to smiling stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Of course we're going to find the right place," she said
      convincingly. "You wait and see. <i>I</i> see it
      now"&#8212;this dreamily; it was odd for the Talentless One
      to be dreaming. "It looks this way: Green, grassy and
      pine-woodsy and roomy. And cornfields&#8212;think of it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Woods and cornfields&#8212;the picture must not be
      over-done,'" quoted softly and a little accusingly Laura Ann.
      But the Talentless One had never heard of Miss Cary's
      beautiful poem, and went on calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "And a&#8212;pump. Girls, if <i>I</i> find the 'Eldorado,'
      there'll be a pump&#8212;painted blue!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Billy woke up. There was no time to discountenance the
      pump.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, I believe I've been asleep!" Billy laughed restedly.
      "And I've been somewhere else, too. Guess!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "To Eldorado," someone ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I have. It was the loveliest place! There weren't any
      pianos or schools or photograph salons or
      <i>handkerchiefs</i> in it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then we'll go there!" the Talentless One cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loraine was busy cutting strips of paper. She cut four of
      varying lengths and dropped them into an empty cracker-box.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Somebody shake them up, everyone shut her eyes and draw
      one," she ordered. "And the person that draws the longest
      slip must be the one to find our Eldorado."
    </p>
    <p>
      They shut their eyes and fumbled in the cracker-box. The room
      was oddly quiet. Laura Ann, who always drew the fatal slip,
      breathed a little hard.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the lot fell to the Talentless One.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      "Why, I didn't get it!" exclaimed Laura Ann, in surprise.
      "And maybe I'm not thankful! Poor T.O.!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, poor T.O.!" agreed Loraine and Billy. The honor of
      drawing the longest slip was not, it appeared, a coveted one.
      But T.O. actually beamed!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Needn't anyone pity me!" she said, briskly. "I like it! You
      see," she added, explanatorily, "I never did anything
      remarkable before! Of course I sha'n't blame you girls any if
      you shake in your shoes while I'm gone, but I'll promise to
      do my little best. If you thought you could trust me&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We do! We do!" Loraine said, warmly, speaking for them all.
      "And we pity you, too, poor dear! It looks like an awful
      undertaking to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "How long can you take? Are you sure they'll let you get off
      down at Torrey's?" asked Billy, languidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," the Talentless One said, calmly, "I shall get a
      substitute, of course. They let the girls do that, if the
      substitute suits 'em. There's a girl that used to be at the
      handkerchief counter that will be glad enough to earn a
      little money, I know. She'll be tickled! And she can keep the
      place open for me when I get back from the country in the
      fall&#8212;" Suddenly the Talentless One laughed out
      joyously. "Hear me! 'When I get back from the country!'
      Doesn't that sound splendid! Makes me think of cows and
      chickens and strawberries and&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Pumps painted blue!" laughed Laura Ann. "We're in for a blue
      pump, girls!"
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      The substitution at the handkerchief counter could not be
      arranged for at once, so the proposed voyage of discovery was
      a little delayed. Meanwhile the Grand Plan and a newly-born
      family of lesser plans occupied the interim of waiting. One
      thing they all agreed upon. It was tired little Billy who
      voiced it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We won't be good this summer, will we? I've been good so
      long that I want to rest!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It would seem comfortable not to have to be, wouldn't it?"
      Loraine laughed. As if Loraine could rest from being good!
      "Not to have to do anything for anybody&#8212;just be good to
      yourself! Now, I call that the luxury of selfishness! And
      really, girls, we deserve one little luxury&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "We'll indulge ourselves," T.O. nodded gravely. "I'm sure
      I've been polite to people and patient with people long
      enough to have a vacation&#8212;a summer vacation!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give me a paper and pencil, somebody, quick!" This from
      Laura Ann. She fell to scribbling industriously. The purring
      of her pencil over the paper had a smooth, wicked sound as if
      it were writing wicked things. It was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be it known," read Laura Ann, flourishing her pencil, "that
      we, the undersigned, having endeavored, up to the present, to
      be good, consider ourselves entitled to be selfish during our
      summer vacation. That we mean to be selfish&#8212;that we
      herewith swear to be! That we do not mean to 'do good unto'
      anybody except ourselves! Inasmuch as we have faithfully
      tried to do our several duties hitherto, we feel justified in
      resting from the same until such time as we
      may&#8212;er&#8212;wish to begin again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Furthermore, resolved: That any or all persons hereunto
      subscribed, who fail to keep the letter of this compact, be
      summarily <i>dropped!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      (Signed) "LAURA ANN BYERS."
    </p>
    <p>
      The paper went the rounds and was soberly signed by each girl
      in turn. Loraine, the last, traced three words in her tiny
      handwriting at the head of the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Wicked Compact!" read Billy over her shoulder, and
      nodded agreeingly. "That's a good name for it. Doesn't it
      make you feel lovely and shuddery to belong to a Wicked
      Compact! Oh, you needn't think I shall go back on the rules
      and regulations! If somebody gets down on his knees and
      implores, 'Which note shall I flat?' I shall turn coldly
      away, or else say, 'Suit yourself, my dear!' But, girls, oh
      girls, I hope there won't be any pianos in Eldorado!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Probably there will be only cabinet organs&#8212;don't
      worry, dear!" soothed Laura Ann.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      The day after the Wicked Compact was drawn up and signed,
      T.O. started on her quest for Eldorado. She would have no one
      escort her to the station; she would give no intimation of
      her plans. They were all to wait as patiently as possible
      till she came back. It was only because she had to, poor
      child, that she accepted the contributions of the others
      toward her expenses of travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the station she straightened her short stature to its
      utmost and approached the ticket window. She might have been,
      from her splendid dignity of manner, six feet instead of
      five.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Will you please tell me which road is the cheapest to travel
      on?" she asked, clearly, undismayed outwardly, inwardly
      quailing before the ticket man's amazement. His curious eyes
      surveyed her through the little opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why&#8212;er&#8212;well, there's the most competition on the
      X &amp; Y Road," he said, slowly. "The rates on that line are
      about down to the limit&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," the dignified one said, and turned away. She
      found the time table of the X &amp; Y Road on the station
      wall, and studied it thoughtfully. She had resolved to select
      the place with the most promising name. Back at the ticket
      window she patiently waited her turn in a little stream of
      people. The woman ahead of her was flourishing a dainty,
      embroidered handkerchief, and she wondered idly if it had
      come from her counter at Torrey's. If so, why was it not a
      little white flag of truce that gave her a right to say "How
      do you do?" to the woman? The Talentless One suddenly felt a
      little lonely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ticket to Placid Pond, please," she said, when her turn
      came. The very sound of the peaceful little name gave her
      courage. Placid Pond! Placid Pond! Could any place be more
      indicative of rest? Then she bethought her of the Wicked
      Compact, and felt almost impelled to hand back the
      ticket&#8212;Placid Pond could not be the right place to be
      bad in!
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was too late!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two-twenty," the ticket man said, monotonously, and she
      fumbled in her lean, little purse. To Placid Pond she would
      go, and, if there were barns and cornfields and a
      blue-painted pump&#8212;the thrill of expectancy ran through
      her veins, and she forgot the Wicked Compact.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Talentless One had never glided through green places like
      this before, between slow, clear little streams, by country
      children waving their hats. She had never seen far, splendid
      reaches of hills, undulating softly against the sky. Wonder
      and delight filled her. She found herself envying the little,
      brown children who waved their hats.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's pretty, ain't it?" a fresh, old voice said in her ear.
      When she turned, it was to look into a fresh, old face behind
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ain't it a pretty world the Lord's made? The 'firmament
      showeth his handiwork,' don't it? Where are you going to,
      deary?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "A place called Placid Pond," answered the girl, smiling
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>No?</i> Well, I declare! That's where Emmeline Camp lives
      that was a Jones an' spelt out o' my spellin'-book! If you
      see Emmeline, you tell her you saw me on the cars. Emmeline
      and I have always kep' up our interest in each other. She'll
      be tickled&#8212;you tell her I've learnt that leaf-stitch at
      last! She'll understand!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The thin, old voice tinkled on pleasantly in the Talentless
      One's ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come back here an' set with me, deary, an' I'll tell you
      which house is Emmeline's, so, if you go past, you'll know
      it&#8212;it's painted green! Did you ever! But Emmeline was
      always set on green. She was married in a green silk, an' we
      girls said she married a green husband!"
    </p>
    <p>
      T.O. laughed enjoyingly. She began to feel acquainted with
      Emmeline, and to hope she should find the green
      house&#8212;perhaps it would be the Eldorado house! Wonders
      happened sometimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I don't suppose&#8212;there isn't a blue pump, is there?
      I've set my heart on a blue pump!" she laughed, as if the
      little, old woman who knew Emmeline would understand. The
      little, old woman smiled delightedly&#8212;as if she
      understood!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear land, no! I hope Emmeline ain't painted her pump
      blue&#8212;and her livin' in a green house! But she'd go out
      an' do it&#8212;it would be just like Emmeline, if she knew
      anybody wanted a blue pump! Here we are, deary! This is
      Placid Pond we're coming to! You see that sheet o' water,
      don't you? Well, that's it!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Talentless One buttoned her jacket and clutched her
      little black bag. Her thin cheeks bloomed suddenly with tiny
      red spots of excitement. She seemed on the edge of an
      Adventure; and, to one who had stood behind a counter nearly
      all her days, an Adventure began with a capital A. The train
      slowed up and stood panting&#8212;in a hurry to go again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, I wish you were going to get out here!" T.O. said,
      wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little, old woman seemed like an old friend to her. She
      felt oddly young and inexperienced. Then, remembering the
      girls left behind in the B-Hive and their confidence in her,
      she threw up her small head and hurried away valiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-by!" she called back, from the bit of platform outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-by! Give my love to Emmeline!" nodded and beamed the
      little, old face in the car window.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a tiny place. T.O. could see only the great, placid
      sheet of water and the diminutive station at first. She
      accosted the only human being in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Which way is the city&#8212;village, I mean?" she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an old man and held a scooped palm behind his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eh?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "The village&#8212;please direct me to it."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," he laughed good-humoredly, "all the village they is
      you'll strike yonder," pointing. "You keep a-goin', an'
      you'll git thar!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She thanked him and set out courageously. She kept "a-goin'."
      The country road was shady and dusty and sweet with mystic,
      unseen, growing things. Her feet, used to hard pavements,
      sank into the soft dust luxuriously. She breathed deep and
      swung along at a splendid pace. It was hard to believe that
      she was a clerk at Torrey's! There did not seem to have ever
      been handkerchiefs in the world&#8212;even all-linen,
      warranted ones!
    </p>
    <p>
      "This is Eldorado!" she said aloud, and was proud of herself
      for finding it so soon&#8212;coming straight to it! Lucky she
      had been the one to draw the longest strip.
    </p>
    <p>
      She passed one or two houses, but none of them were painted
      green. She said to herself she would keep on to "Emmeline's"
      house. The whim had seized her and was holding on tight that
      Emmeline's might be the Right Place. So she swung on
      buoyantly.

      "'WHICH WAY IS THE VILLAGE?' SHE ASKED.">
    </center>
    <p>
      A stone wall bordered the road on one side, and over the wall
      she spied a sprinkling of little flowers that called, "Come
      and pick us!" to her. She did not know that they were bluets,
      but she knew they were dainty and sweet and beckoned to her.
      She paused an instant uncertainly, and then climbed the wall.
      It was rather an arduous undertaking for a clerk at a
      handkerchief counter, and she went about it clumsily. The
      wall was high and the stones "jiggled" in a terrifying way.
      One big stone climbed down on the other side with
      her&#8212;they went together unceremoniously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Talentless One laughed a little under her breath as she
      sat up among the little flowers, but she was not quite sure
      that she wanted to laugh. The big stone was on her foot and
      she regarded it with disfavor. It required considerable
      strength to roll it off&#8212;then she got up. Then she sank
      down again very suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" she cried, sharply. For several moments she said
      nothing more, did nothing more. The discovery she had made
      was not a pleasant discovery. In Eldorado clumsy people who
      could not climb stone walls came to grief. She had come to
      grief. When she moved her foot, terrible twinges of pain were
      telegraphed all over her body. She sat, a sorry little heap,
      among the stranger flowers that had brought about her ruin.
      The roadway stretched dustily and emptily up and down, on the
      other side of the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" breathed the Talentless One. It had been a sigh before,
      now it was a groan. What was she to do? A sort of terror
      seized her. She had never been really frightened before. The
      beautiful country about her no longer was beautiful. It was
      no longer Eldorado to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she discovered a green fleck down the road, a different
      green from the grass and trees. If it should be Emmeline's
      house&#8212;if she could get to it!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I must!" she said, and hobbled to her feet. Somehow she got
      over the wall, and went stumbling toward the green spot. The
      agony in her foot increased every moment; she grew dizzy with
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be Emmeline's house&#8212;a little, green-painted one
      beside the road! There could not be two green houses in
      Placid Pond. With a long breath of relief she got to the
      door. After that she did not know anything for a little time,
      then her eyes opened. Someone with a kind, anxious face was
      bending over her. It was Emmeline! It looked like the face of
      an old friend to the poor, little Talentless One.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There, there, poor dear! Never mind where you be, or who I
      be&#8212;you 'tend right to gettin' out o' your faint! Sniff
      this bottle&#8212;there! You'll be all right in a minute.
      It's your foot, ain't it? It's all swollen up&#8212;how'd you
      sprain it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had the injured foot in her tremulous old hands, gently
      loosening the shoe. The girl, though she winced with pain,
      did not utter a sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There ain't any doctor this side of Anywhere," the kind
      voice ran on, "but never you mind. I'll risk but what I've
      got liniments that will doctor you up."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the girl, looking up into the peaceful old "lineaments,"
      smiled faintly, and knew there was healing in them. Even in
      her throbbing pain she could think of this new pun that she
      would regale the girls with when she got back to
      them&#8212;if she ever got back!
    </p>
    <p>
      "You are 'Emmeline,' aren't you!" she presently questioned,
      feebly, like an old woman, for the pain seemed to have made
      her old. "I'm so glad you are Emmeline!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor dear, she was wandering in her mind, and no wonder, with
      a foot swollen up like that! It was queer, though, hitting on
      the right name in that way.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There! there! Yes, I am Emmeline, though I might've been
      Sophia or Debby Jane! Namin' people is sort o' accidental. I
      always wished they'd named me somethin' prettier by accident!
      But I guess Emmeline will have to do."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was long after this before any explanation was made. The
      fact that it was Emmeline was enough for those first hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now, you kind of bear on to yourself, poor dear! This boot
      has got to come off!" the kind voice crooned. But, in the
      awful process of "bearing on," the Talentless One shot out
      into the dark, as if pushed by a heavy hand. How long it was
      before she came back into the light she did not know&#8212;it
      seemed to be a point of light that pricked her eyes. She shut
      them against it, and longed to drift away again; the dark had
      been cool and pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a lighted lamp on a tiny, round table. She found it
      out the next time she opened her eyes. She was in a little
      bedroom, on the bed. The door was open, and a voice drifted
      in to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      "She was coming to beautifully when I left her. I thought
      mebbe she'd feel more at home to come to alone. I've got her
      ankle all dressed nice, but it would make your heart ache to
      see it! The poor dear won't walk again this one while&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "But, Emmeline Camp, what are you going to do with her all
      that time?" The second voice was a little shrill.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Sh! I'm goin' to doctor her up, just as if she was the
      little girl the Lord never gave me. I've always known what
      I'd do if my little girl broke anything&#8212;There! you'll
      have to excuse me, Mrs. Williams, while I take this cup o'tea
      in."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is odd how many little confidences can be exchanged in the
      time of cooling and drinking a cup of tea. The caller had
      gone away, and the old woman and the girl were left alone.
      Little by little the story of the B-Hive and the quest for an
      Eldorado came out. Emmeline Camp sat and nodded, and
      clandestinely wiped her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see&#8212;I see, deary! Now, don't you talk any more and
      get faint again. I'll talk. You no need to worry about
      anything in the world&#8212;not yet! When it's time to
      commence, I'll tell you. How does your foot feel now? Dear,
      dear! When I was fussing over it, it seemed just as if it was
      my little Amelia's foot! I've always known what I'd do if she
      sprained hers, and so I did it to yours, deary!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is Amelia your daughter?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The old face wavered between a smile and tears. "Yes," she
      nodded, "but she warn't ever born. It's a kind of a secret
      between me and the Lord. He knows I've made believe Amelia.
      I've always been kind of lonesome, an' she's been a sight of
      company to me. She's been a good daughter, Amelia has!" Now
      it was a smile. "We've set an' sewed patchwork together, ever
      since she grew up. When she was little&#8212;there, deary,
      hear me run on! But you remind me so much of Amelia. You can
      laugh just as much as you want to at me runnin' on like this
      about a little girl that warn't ever born&#8212;mebbe
      laughin' will help your foot."
    </p>
    <p>
      She took up the empty cup and went away, but she came back
      and stood a minute in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There's this about it," she laughed, in a tender, little
      way, "if she warn't ever born, she won't ever die. I sha'n't
      lose Amelia!"
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      To the three girls waiting at the B-Hive came a letter. They
      read it, three heads in a bunch:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Eldorado, June 26.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Come whenever you want to. Directions enclosed."
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>

    </p><a name="CH3"><!-- CH3 --></a>
    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was a postscript. It was like T.O. to put the most of
      the letter into the postscript.
    </p>
    <p>
      "P.S.&#8212;Never call me the Talentless One again" (as if
      they ever had!), "when I came straight to the
      Eldorado&#8212;tumbled right into it. I've decided to stay
      here until you come&#8212;please tell my substitute so. I
      know she'll be so glad she'll throw up her hat. Bring your
      sheets and pillow-cases. Come by way of the X. &amp; Y. R.R.
      to a place called Placid Pond."
    </p>
    <p>
      The three readers, bunched together over the letter, uttered
      a cry of delight. "Placid Pond!"&#8212;of all the dear,
      delightful, placid names! The very look of it on paper was
      restful; it <i>sounded</i> restful when you said it over and
      over&#8212;"Placid Pond. Placid Pond. Placid Pond."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, she's a dear&#8212;she's an <i>artist!</i>" cried Laura
      Ann, who measured all things by their relationship to art.
      This was an own cousin!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Read on&#8212;somebody hold the letter still!" Billy cried
      excitedly. And they read on: "Take the only road there is to
      take, and keep on to a house that's painted green. It will be
      Emmeline's house, though they might have named her Sophia,
      she says, by accident. But you will be glad she is Emmeline.
      She has a beautiful daughter that never was born and never
      will die&#8212;oh, girls, come as quick as ever you can!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Yours, "The Talented One."
    </p>
    <p>
      "P.S. No. 2.&#8212;Don't climb any stone walls. The stones
      are not stuck on."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a tiny space the three girls looked at each other in
      silence. The letter in Loraine's hand was a masterpiece, full
      of enticing mysteries that beckoned to them to come and find
      the "answers." What kind of an Eldorado was this that was
      called Placid Pond, and was full of mysteries? How could they
      wait! They must pack up and go at once!
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Talented One,' indeed!&#8212;she's a genius! See how she's
      left us to guess things, instead of explaining them all out
      in a nice, tame way&#8212;oh, <i>girls</i>"&#8212;Laura Ann's
      eyes shone&#8212;"won't we have the greatest time!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What I want to know is, who is Emmeline&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, who is Emmeline?" "And who <i>can</i> her daughter
      <i>be</i>? She sounds so lovely and ghostly!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Everything sounds lovely and ghostly. When can we go,
      girls?" This from practical Loraine. "<i>I</i> can't till
      after the Fourth."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nor I," groaned Billy, dolefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I could, but I shall not&#8212;I shall wait for you two,"
      Laura Ann said quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loraine turned upon her. "You needn't," she said, "now that
      you've signed the compact&#8212;you can do whatever you
      <i>want</i> to now, you know. Needn't think of anybody but
      yourself."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The privilege of being selfish doesn't begin till we get to
      Eldorado," laughed Laura Ann. "You'll see what I do then!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was arranged that they should start on the fifth of July.
      "With our sheets and pillow-cases," appended Billy. No one
      thought of writing to T.O. for further particulars. No one
      wanted further particulars. The uncertainly and mystery that
      enveloped Eldorado was its greatest charm. They speculated,
      to be sure, at odd moments, as to the identity of the person
      who might have been Sophia but was Emmeline, and they
      wrestled a little with the hidden meaning of Postscript
      Number Two. Why were they especially bidden not to climb
      stone walls? And <i>why</i> was the Talented One "staying
      over" till they came?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why? Why? Why?" chanted Billy, "but don't anybody dare to
      guess why! Who wants to know!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not me!" echoed ungrammatically Laura Ann.
    </p>
    <p>
      While they waited and speculated mildly, and packed and
      repacked their things, T.O. lay on the bed in Emmeline Camp's
      little bedroom and winced with pain whenever she moved her
      wounded foot. But she was very happy. "Peace is in my soul,
      if not my <i>sole!</i>" she thought, a slave still to the
      punning habit. She had never been so peaceful in her life.
      The little old woman who had befriended her bustled happily
      in and out of the little bedroom. She bathed and rubbed the
      swollen ankle, and smiled and chattered to the girl at the
      other end of it. Her "lineaments" were working a cure,
      surely.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had all been decided upon. The B-Hive was to be
      transplanted for the summer to the little, green-painted
      house trailed over with morning-glory vines and roses.
      Emmeline Camp had wanted, she said, for forty years, to go
      upon a long journey, to visit her brother. Here was her
      chance. The small sum she had at last consented to be paid
      for the use of her little house would pay her traveling
      expenses one way, at least, and John would be glad enough,
      she said, to pay her fare home, to get rid of her! Only she
      was quite able to pay it herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've kind of hankered to go to see John all these years.
      Forty years is quite a spell to hanker, isn't it? But I never
      felt like leaving the house behind, and I couldn't take it
      along very conveniently, so I stayed to home. And
      then&#8212;my dear, you can laugh as well as not, but I
      didn't like to leave Amelia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But you might have taken her with&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," seriously, "I couldn't 've taken Amelia. I think,
      deary, it might 've killed her; she's part of the little
      house and the morning-glories and roses. I'd have had to
      leave Amelia if I'd gone, and it didn't seem right."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But now&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Now," the little, old woman laughed in her odd, tender way
      that "went with" Amelia, "now she'll have plenty of young
      company&#8212;all o' you here with her. I shall make believe
      she's coming and going with you, and it'll be a sight of
      comfort. Yes, deary, I guess this is going to be my chance to
      visit John."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And our chance to have a summer in the country," completed
      the Talented One. "Oh, I think you are&#8212;<i>dear</i>!
      Whatever will the other girls say when I tell them about
      you!"
    </p>
    <p>
      One day T.O. remembered the blue pump. She gazed out of the
      window at the brown one in the little yard. "Who would have
      thought," she sighed, "that I could be so happy without a
      blue pump!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "What's that, deary?" The little, old woman was sewing
      patchwork near by.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh," laughed the girl, "I always <i>did</i> want a pump that
      was painted blue. I saw a picture of one once when I was a
      little mite, and it impressed me&#8212;such a lovely, bright
      blue! I thought it went beautifully with the green grass! But
      I can get along without it, I guess."
    </p>
    <p>
      "We have to get along without having things painted to suit
      us," nodded the little, old woman philosophically. But she
      remembered the blue pump. There was a can of paint out in the
      shed room, and there was Jane Cotton's Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane Cotton's Sam was a "feature" of Placid Pond&#8212;a
      whole set of features, T.O. said. He was a lumbering, awkward
      fellow, well up to the end of his teens, the only hope of
      widowed Jane. The Lord had given him a splendid head, but the
      Placid Pond people were secretly triumphing in the knowledge
      that Sam had failed to pass in his college examinations,
      "head or no head." Jane had always boasted so of Sam's
      brains, and predicted such a wonderful future for him! All
      her soul was set on Sam's success&#8212;well, wasn't it time
      her pride had a fall? Mebbe now she'd see Sam wasn't much
      different from other people's boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane's heart was reported to be broken by the boy's failure,
      and Sam went about sulkily defiant. He made a great pretense
      of lofty indifference, but maybe he didn't care!&#8212;maybe
      not! Emmeline Camp knew in her gentle old heart that he
      cared. She worried about Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this the Talented One learned, little by little, in the
      way country gossip is learned. She learned many other things,
      too, about the neighbors&#8212;things that she lay and
      pondered about. It seemed queer to find out that even a
      placid little place like this, set among the peaceful hills,
      had its tragedies and comedies&#8212;its pitiful little
      skeletons behind the doors.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's Old '61," Mrs. Camp said, pointing to an old figure
      in the road. "See him go marching past!&#8212;he always
      marches, as if he heard drums beating and he was keeping
      time. I tell 'em he <i>does</i> hear 'em. He lives all alone
      up on the edge o' the woods, and folks say he spends most all
      his time trying to pick march tunes out on the organ. A few
      years ago he got some back pension money, and up and spent it
      for a cabinet organ! Dear land! it seemed a pity, when he
      might have got him some nice clothes or something sensible.
      But there he sets and sets over that organ, trying to pick
      out tunes! Well,"&#8212;the gentle old voice took on
      charity&#8212;"well, if that's his way of being happy, I
      s'pose he's got as good a right to it as I have
      to&#8212;Amelia," a whimsical little smile lighting up the
      old face, but underlying it the tenderness that the girl on
      the bed had come to look for whenever any reference was made
      to Amelia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "We've all got our idiosyncreases," added Emmeline Camp,
      "only some of 'em's creased in a little deeper'n others. I
      guess mine and Old '61's are pretty considerable deep!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The early July days were cloudless and full of hot, stinging
      noises. T.O. crawled out to lie in the grass under a great
      tree, and exult in room and freedom and rest. Her ankle was
      still very painful, but she regarded it with philosophical
      toleration: "You needn't have climbed a stone wall, need you?
      Well, then, what have you to complain of? The best thing you
      can do is to keep still." Which was, without doubt, the
      truth. "Anyhow, it isn't becoming in you to be so puffed up!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was decided that Mrs. Camp should start on her trip before
      the other girls arrived. Hence, on the morning of the day
      they had set to come, the little old woman and her bags and
      bundles rode away down the dusty country road. Her lean,
      brown, crumpled old face had an exalted expression; the joy
      of anticipation and the triumph of patient waiting met in it
      and blended oddly. It was a great day for Emmeline Camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-by, deary. Keep right on rubbing, and don't go to
      walking 'round. There's some cookies left in the cooky-crock,
      and a pie or two on the shelf to kind of set you going. Take
      good care o' yourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And Amelia," whispered the girl, drawing the old face down
      to her. "We'll take good care of Amelia."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a little lonely after the old stage rumbled away. The
      Talented One turned whimsically to Amelia for company. She
      tried to imagine her, as the little old woman did, but in
      vain. She could not conjure up the sweet, elusive face, the
      hair, the eyes, the grave little mouth of Amelia. The little
      old woman had taken away with her love, the key. She must
      have taken Amelia away with her, too, the girl thought,
      smiling at her own fancy. So, for company, she must wait
      until Loraine and Billy and Laura Ann came, on the further
      edge of the day. She lay in the cool grass, and made beatific
      plans for all the long, lazy days to come. No hurrying, or
      worrying&#8212;each one for herself, happy in her own way.
      Only themselves to think of for the space of a golden summer!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am glad she took Amelia," the girl in the grass laughed
      softly. "We'd never be able to keep to the Compact with
      Amelia 'round&#8212;Amelia would never have signed a 'Wicked
      Compact'!" Which, in the event of gentle, unsinning Amelia
      ever having been born, might or might not have been true. It
      would have been harder work, reflected the girl in the grass,
      for Amelia to have been unsinning and gentle, if she had been
      born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane Cotton's Sam came lounging down the road, cap over one
      eye, face surlily defiant. T.O. watched him with displeasure.
      So that was the kind of a boy that gave up? Poor kind of a
      boy! Why didn't he try it again, especially when his poor
      mother's heart was breaking? Didn't he know that giving up
      was worse than failing in his examinations? Somebody ought to
      tell him&#8212;why, he was stopping at Mrs. Camp's little
      front gate! He was coming in!
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl lying in the long grass under the tree sat up
      hurriedly. Quick, quick! what was his name? Oh, yes, Sam!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning, Sam," she said pleasantly. But the boy, with a
      mere nod of his splendidly-modeled head, hurried away toward
      the tiny barn. The girl had seen the dark flush that mounted
      upward from his neck over his pink and white cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor thing! He knows <i>I</i> know that he didn't
      pass&#8212;that is the only 'out' about living in the
      country: everybody knows everything. Well, if it makes him
      blush, then his mother needn't break her heart <i>yet</i>. I
      like the looks of that boy, if he does go 'round scowling."
      Whereupon the Talented One promptly dismissed Jane Cotton's
      Sam from her meditations. It did not occur to her to question
      his right to be on Mrs. Camp's premises. She lay back in the
      grass and took up again the interrupted thread of her
      musings. By gentle degrees odd fancies took possession of
      her.

      "THE BOY, WITH A MERE NOD, HURRIED AWAY.">
    </center>
    <p>
      The sprinkling of great, white daisies in the grass beside
      her&#8212;suppose, now, this minute, they changed into white
      handkerchiefs, spread out on a green counter! Then she would
      have to sell them to passers-by; it was her business to sell
      handkerchiefs. Someone was coming marching up the
      road&#8212;suppose she tried to sell him one, for the fun of
      it!&#8212;to make a good story for the girls. Laughing, she
      got up and leaned on the fence. She "dared" herself to do it.
      Then, courteously, "Can I sell you anything in handkerchiefs
      to-day? Initialed, embroidered&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      The marching feet stopped. Shrewd old eyes studied her face
      and twinkled, responsive to the harmless mischief visible in
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You got any with flags on&#8212;in the corners or anywhere?
      Or drums on?" It was Old '61. "Or red, white an' blue ones?
      I'd like one o' <i>them</i>&#8212;I fit in the war,"
      explanatorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes?" The saleswoman was not especially interested in the
      war; it is not the way with many of her kind to be interested
      in things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I fit clear through&#8212;in the Wilderness, and Bull Run,
      an' plenty more. They couldn't get rid o' me, the enemy
      couldn't! No, sir, where there was marchin' an' shootin', I
      was bound to be there! They hit me time 'n' again, but I
      didn't waste no unnecessary time in hospittles&#8212;I had to
      git back to the boys."
    </p>
    <p>
      She was interested now; she forgot she was to sell him a
      handkerchief. "Go on," she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was great! You ought to heard the drums an' smelt the
      smoke, an' felt your feet marchin' under you, an' your
      knapsack poundin' your back&#8212;yes, sir, an' bein' hungry
      an' thirsty an' wore out! You'd ought to seen how ragged the
      boys got, an' heard 'em whistlin' 'Through Georgy' while they
      sewed on patches&#8212;oh, you'd ought to <i>whistled</i>
      'Through Georgy'!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, watching the kindled old face, saw a shadow creep
      over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I useter&#8212;I useter&#8212;but someway I've lost it. It's
      pretty hard to've <i>marched</i> through Georgy an' forgot
      the tune about. Some days I 'most get holt of it
      again&#8212;I thought I could, on the organ, but I can't, not
      the hull of it. Someway I've lost it&#8212;it's pretty hard.
      It ha'nts me&#8212;if you ever be'n ha'nted, you know how bad
      it is."
    </p>
    <p>
      No, the girl who was leaning on the fence had never been
      ha'nted, but her eyes were wide with pity for the old soul
      who had marched through Georgia and forgotten the tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some days I 'most ketch it. I don't suppose"&#8212;the old
      voice halted diffidently&#8212;"I don't suppose <i>you'd</i>
      whistle it, would you? Jest through once&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      But she could not whistle even once "Through Georgia." "I'm
      so sorry!" she cried. "I can't whistle, or sing, or anything.
      I wish I could!" She wished she were Billy; Billy could have
      done it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old '61 marched on, up the dusty road, and the girl went back
      to her tree. She had not sold any daisy-handkerchiefs, but
      she had her story to tell the girls. She lay in the grass
      thinking of it. Once or twice she pursed her lips and made a
      ludicrous ineffectual attempt to whistle, but she did not
      smile. Jane Cotton's Sam clicked the gate, going out, but she
      did not notice. When she did at last look up, and her gaze
      wandered over the little yard aimlessly, she suddenly uttered
      a little note of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why!" she cried.
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.
    </h2>
    <p>
      For the pump was a blue pump! A miracle had been wrought
      while she mused in the grass and listened to Old '61. The
      little old brown pump had blossomed out gayly, brilliantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why!" Then a subdued chuckle reached her from some nearby
      ambush out beyond the fence. She put two and two
      together&#8212;the pump, the laugh, and Jane Cotton's Sam.
      Six! Jane Cotton's Sam, while she was day-dreaming and
      Marching through Georgia with Old '61, had painted the brown
      pump blue! That was his business on Mrs. Camp's premises. Mrs
      Camp had remembered&#8212;the dear, oh, the dear!&#8212;that
      she wanted a blue pump, and had got the boy to come and make
      one. And now, down behind the fence somewhere, the boy was
      laughing at her amazement. Well, let him laugh&#8212;she
      laughed, too! Suddenly she began to clap her hands by way of
      applause to her hidden audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pump itself was distinctly a disappointment. In gay-hued
      pictures, seen by childish eyes, blue pumps accord with green
      grass and trees&#8212;in nature, seen by maturer eyes, there
      is something wrong with the colors. They look out of
      place&#8212;either the green growing things or the gay blue
      pump do not belong there. The girl's loyalty to little, kind
      Emmeline Camp would not let her admit that it was the blue
      pump that didn't "belong." She was glad&#8212;glad&#8212;that
      it was blue, for it stood for a thoughtful kindness to her,
      and thoughtful kindnesses had been rare in her
      self-dependent, hustling life.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Hurrah for the blue pump!" she cried softly. She felt like
      going up to it and hugging it, but fortunately she did not
      yield to the impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other girls arrived at dusk. T.O., her knee in a chair,
      had hitched laboriously from little kitchen to little
      dining-room and got supper. Spent and triumphant, she waited
      in the doorway. She could hear their voices coming up the
      road&#8212;Billy's excited voice, Laura Ann's gay one,
      Loraine's calm and sweet. She longed to run out to meet them.
      Next best, she sent her own voice, in a clear, long call.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's T.O.! Girls, let's run!" she heard Billy say.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why doesn't <i>she</i> run?" Laura Ann demanded severely.
      "That would be perfectly appropriate under the
      circumstances."
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Tis queer, isn't it, that she didn't come to meet us?"
      Loraine added. In another moment they had reached Emmeline
      Camp's little green-painted house and found the Talented One
      waiting impatiently at the gate. Things explained themselves
      rapidly. Exclamations of pity crowded upon exclamations of
      delight and welcome. Four happy young wage-earners sat down
      to T.O.'s hardly-prepared little supper and four tongues were
      loosed. Even Loraine did her part of the chattering.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I feel so nice and <i>placid</i> already!" enthused Billy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, so do I!&#8212;so do I!" echoed Laura Ann. "It's such a
      comfort to get one's chains off!&#8212;I felt mine slip off
      back there at that dear, funny little station."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, was <i>that</i> what I heard clanking?" offered quiet
      Loraine, and was promptly cheered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meal was a merry one. And afterwards there was exploring
      to be done about the little yard and orchard and up and down
      the road, in the dim, sweet twilight, with the Talented One
      at the gate calling soft directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And I've got a blue pump for you," she laughed. "Just wait
      till daylight! Don't anybody feel of it in the dark to see if
      it's blue, because you'll find it's green! There's a story
      goes with the pump and one with its mother&#8212;I mean with
      the boy-who-painted-its mother! Placid Pond is full of
      stories."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Nice, dozy, placid ones, I suppose," Laura Ann returned
      lightly. But the Talented One shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait till you hear them," she said gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Give us some of the titles to-night," coaxed Billy. They
      were all back on the little doorsteps and the moon was
      rising, majestic and golden, behind the trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well&#8212;" she considered thoughtfully, "there's 'The
      Story of Amelia', and the story of 'The Boy Who Didn't Pass',
      and the one of 'Old '61'&#8212;",
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, tell us&#8212;tell us!" Billy pleaded, and would not be
      refused. It was never easy to refuse Billy. She had her way
      this time, and there in the mellow night-light, with soft
      night-noises all about them, T.O. told her stories. She had
      never told a story before in her life, and her voice at first
      stumbled diffidently, but as she went on, a queer thing
      happened&#8212;she did not seem to be telling it herself, but
      the little old woman who loved Amelia seemed to be telling
      it! Then the Boy Who Didn't Pass, then Old '61, in his
      tremulous, halting old voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      They listened in perfect silence, and even after the stories
      ended they said nothing. Billy, quite unashamed, was crying
      over poor Old '61.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You'd have thought, wouldn't you," T.O. murmured after a
      while, "that places like this would be humdrum-y and
      commonplace? But I guess there are 'stories' everywhere. I'm
      beginning to find out things, girls."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day began in earnest the long-yearned-for time of
      rest. It was decided unanimously over the breakfast cups, to
      live and move, eat and all but sleep, out of doors. To devote
      four separate and four combined energies to having a good
      time. To abide by the rules and regulations of the Wicked
      Compact&#8212;long live the Wicked Compact! Laura Ann made an
      illuminated copy of it, framed it in a border of
      hurriedly-painted forget-me-nots and hung it on the screen
      door, where they could not help seeing it and "remembering
      their vows," Laura Ann said. It was a matter of gay
      conjecture with them who would be the first to break the
      Compact.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And be driven out of the B-Hive&#8212;not I!" Billy said
      decisively. "I shan't have the least temptation to break it,
      anyway&#8212;I feel selfish all over! You couldn't drive me
      to do a good deed with a&#8212;a pitchfork!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Me either&#8212;not even with a darning-needle!" laughed
      Laura Ann. "If anybody asks me to lend her a pin, hear me
      say, 'Can't, my dear; it's against the rules.' Needn't
      anybody worry about losing me out o' the Hive!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Loraine will be the one&#8212;you see," T.O. said lazily.
      "And what I want to know is, how are we going to live without
      Loraine? I vote we append a by-law. By-law I.: 'Resolved,
      that we except Loraine&#8212;just Loraine.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Second the motion," murmured Billy, on her back in the
      grass, nibbling clover heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," Loraine said severely, "I refuse to be put into a
      by-law."
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      The summer days were long days&#8212;lazy, somnolent days.
      The four girls spent them each in her own separate way.
      Sometimes the little colony met only at mealtimes&#8212;with
      glowing reports of the mornings' or afternoons' wanderings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy, it was noticed, although like the rest she wandered
      abroad, made no reports. Had she had a good time?
      Yes&#8212;yes, of course. Where had she been all the morning
      or all the afternoon? Oh&#8212;oh, to places. Woods?
      Yes&#8212;that is, almost woods. And more than that they
      failed to elicit. Nearly every day she started away by
      herself, and after awhile they noticed that she went in the
      same direction. She went briskly, alertly, like one with a
      definite end in view. Now, where did Billy go? Their vagrant
      curiosity was aroused, but not yet to the point of
      investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old '61 knew. Every morning since that first morning he had
      strained his dim old eyes to catch a glimpse of a little
      figure coming blithely up the road. On that first morning it
      had stopped in front of his little house and said pleasant
      things to him as he sat on the doorsteps. He remembered all
      the things.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning! It's a splendid day, isn't it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      And: "What a perfectly lovely place you live in! With the
      woods so near you can shake hands with them out of your
      windows!"
    </p>
    <p>
      And: "Don't the birds wake you up mornings? I wonder what
      they sing about up here." Then she had glanced at his ancient
      army coat and added the Pleasantest Thing Of All: "I think
      they must sing Battle Hymns and Red, White and Blue songs and
      'Marching Through Georgia,' don't they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not the last one," he had answered sadly. "They never sing
      that. If they did, I'd 'a' learnt it of 'em long ago."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you like that one best&#8212;very best?" she had asked,
      and he liked to remember how she had smiled. He had stood up
      then and thrown back his old shoulders proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why, you see, marm," he had said simply, "I <i>marched</i>
      through Georgy!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, too, she had stopped and talked to him. But
      it was not until the third time that he had ventured to ask
      her to whistle it. And then&#8212;Old '61, now peering down
      the road for the blithe little figure, thrilled again at the
      remembrance of what had happened. She had laughed gently and
      said she did not know how to whistle, but if he would like
      her to sing it&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been eight mornings all told, now, counting this
      morning, which was sure to be. Yes, clear 'way down there
      somebody was comin' swingin' along&#8212;somebody little an'
      happy an' spry. Old '61 began to laugh softly. He could
      hardly wait for her to come and sit down on the doorstep and
      sing it. Two or three times&#8212;she would sing it two or
      three times.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had a surprise for her this morning. With great pains he
      had dragged his cabinet organ out onto the little porch. It
      was all open, ready. He went a little way down the road in
      his eagerness to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning!" Billy called brightly. "Am I late to-day?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Jest a little&#8212;jest a little," he quavered joyously,
      "but I'll forgive ye! There's somethin' waitin' up
      there&#8212;I've got a surprise for ye!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Honest?" Billy stood still in the road, looking into the
      eager, childish old face. "Oh, goody! I love surprises. Am I
      to guess it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, no, jest to come an' play on it!" he quavered. Then a
      cloud settled over his face and dimmed the delight in it.
      "Mebbe you don't know how to?" he added, a tremulous upward
      lift to his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "How to 'play on' a surprise!" cried Billy. "Well, how am I
      to know until I see it? I can play on 'most everything else!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They had got to the little front gate&#8212;were going up the
      little carefully-weeded path&#8212;were very close to it now.
      Billy sprang up the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can! I can!" she laughed. "Hear me!" Her fingers ran up
      and down the keys, then settled into a soft, sweet little
      melody. Another and another&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man on the lower step sat patiently listening and
      waiting. If she did not play it soon, he should have to ask
      her to, but he would rather have her play it without. Perhaps
      the next one&#8212;
    </p>
    <p>
      The next one was beautiful, but not It&#8212;not
      <i>It</i>&#8212;not the Right One.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There!" finished Billy with a flourish. "You see, I
      <i>can</i> play on a surprise!" She stopped abruptly at sight
      of the disappointed old face below her. For an instant she
      was bewildered, then a beautiful instinct that had lain
      unused on some shelf of Billy's mind came to life and
      whispered to her what the trouble was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" she cried softly, "Oh, I'm sorry I forgot!" She turned
      back to the little organ and began to play again.

    </center>
    <p>
      Up went the sagging old head, up the sagging old shoulders!
      Old '61 was back in "Georgy," marching through mud and
      pine-barrens, in cold and hunger and weariness&#8212;with the
      boys, from Atlanta to the sea. Hurrah! hurrah! the flag that
      made them free!
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not old, not alone and forlorn and cumbering the
      earth. He was young and straight and loyal, defying suffering
      and death, with glory and fame, perhaps, on there ahead. His
      country needed him&#8212;he was marching through Georgia for
      his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Billy played it over and over, untiring. A lump grew in her
      throat at the sight of the old face down there on the lower
      step. For so much was written on the old face!
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Old '61 got up and began to march, swinging his old
      legs out splendidly. Down the walk, down the road, he went,
      as far as the music went, then came marching splendidly back.
      Head up, shoulders squared, the "boys" marching invisible
      beside him and before him and behind him, he was no longer
      Old '61, but Young '61.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Billy ate her breakfast quietly, helped clear
      away the things, and went quietly away. She did not stop to
      read Laura Ann's gay-painted "Compact" on the screen door. It
      might even have been noticed, if anyone cared to notice, that
      she did not look at it, that she hurried a little through the
      door, as if to avoid it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old '61 was waiting at the gate. She smiled at the eager
      invitation she read in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No," she said, shaking her head for emphasis, "no, I'm not
      going to play it this time. I'm going to teach you to play
      it! I shall be going back to the city before long, and then
      what will you do when you want to hear it? Perhaps you
      couldn't keep the tune in your head. I'm going to show you an
      easy way to play it&#8212;just the air. I shall have to try
      it myself first, of course. But I'm sure you can learn how,
      if you'll practice faithfully." It was queer how her
      music-teacher tone crept back into her voice. She laughed to
      herself to hear it. "Practice faithfully" sounded so natural
      to say!
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down at the organ and experimented thoughtfully,
      trying to reduce the old man's beloved tune to its very
      lowest terms. After quite a long time she nodded and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then began Old '61s music lessons. It was terrible work, like
      earning a living with the sweat of the brow. But the two of
      them&#8212;the young woman and the old man&#8212;bent to it
      heroically. For an hour, that first time, the cramped old
      fingers felt their way over the keyboard; for an hour Billy
      bent over them, patiently pointing the way. She had forgotten
      that she was not to think of piano-notes now&#8212;that she
      had signed the Wicked Compact. She had forgotten everything
      but her determination to teach Old '61 to play "Marching
      through Georgia." And Old '61 had, in his turn, forgotten
      things&#8212;that he was old, alone, a cumberer, everything
      but his determination to learn It.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a scientific lesson. It did not begin with first
      principles and creep slowly upward; it began in the middle,
      in a splendid, haphazard, ambitious way. The stiff old hands
      were gently placed in position for the first notes of the
      tune, the stiff old fingers were pressed gently down, one at
      a time. Over and over and over the process was repeated. It
      was learning by sheer brute patience and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's all for the first lesson," Billy announced at the end
      of the hour. "You've got those first notes well enough to
      practice them. To-morrow we'll go a little bit farther." But
      she did not know the long, patient hours between now and then
      that the old man would "practice," crooked painfully over the
      keys. She did not reckon on the miracle that might be wrought
      out of intense desire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Old '61 at the gate proclaimed proudly:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've got it! I've got it! I can play an' sing fur as we've
      b'en! It's ringin' in my head all the time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did the birds wake you up singing it?" Billy asked,
      smilingly. She, herself, was all eagerness to learn of her
      pupil's progress. The lesson began at once. Already, she
      found, the miracle had begun to work. The old man sat down to
      the organ with a flourish that, if it had not been full of
      pathos, would have been a little comedy act. After a brief
      preliminary search the old fingers found their place and
      pounded out triumphantly the few notes they had been taught.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good! good!" applauded the teacher heartily. "Why, you do it
      splendidly! Now we'll go on a little farther&#8212;this
      finger on this note, this one here, your thumb <i>here</i>."
      She stationed them carefully and the second lesson began. It
      was nearer two hours than one when it ended.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      "Where have <i>you</i> been, Billy?" Loraine asked at lunch.
      They had all been describing their individual pursuits and
      experiences of the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, to a place," answered Billy lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What place?" Loraine persisted curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," laughed Billy, "if you must know, I've been marching
      through&#8212;oh, a <i>place</i>!" she concluded hastily,
      repenting herself. "It was a pretty hard place, and I'm
      hungry as a bear. Wish somebody'd say, 'Won't you have
      another piece of pie?'"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Won't you have another piece of pie?" laughed Loraine, and
      nothing further was said of an embarrassing nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer days grew into summer weeks. Patiently and
      joyously Old '61 plodded his way to the sea. He practiced
      nearly all his waking hours, and when he was not at the
      little organ, practicing, he went about humming the beloved
      words. Pride and love, rather than any melody of his cracked
      old voice, made a tune of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      His progress astonished his teacher. Her praise was impetuous
      enough for further and greater exertions. One day Billy said
      the next time should be an exhibition, when he should play it
      all&#8212;from "Atlanta to the sea"&#8212;with her as
      audience, not helping, but sitting in a chair listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came to the Exhibition in a white dress, with sweet-peas
      at her waist. Her smiles at the foot of the steps changed to
      something like a sob when she discovered that Old '61 had
      been decorating the organ and the little porch. He, himself,
      was brushed and radiant, his old face the face of a little
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The audience will sit on the steps," Billy said, a little
      tremulously. "Right here. Make believe I'm rows and rows of
      people! Now will you please favor us by 'Marching through
      Georgia'?".
    </p>
    <p>
      He went at once to the little gayly-bedecked instrument and
      began to play. The dignity and pride of the shabby old figure
      redeemed its shabbiness&#8212;the fervor of the pounded notes
      redeemed the tune. The audience&#8212;in "rows and
      rows,"&#8212;listened gravely, and at the end burst into
      genuine applause. The sound swelled and multiplied oddly, and
      then they saw the three figures at the gate who had listened,
      too. Billy was discovered!

      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      They escorted Billy home. It was rather a silent walk until
      the end. Loraine spoke first.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One less in the B-Hive," she said sadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I suppose I'm dropped now," responded Billy, not
      uncheerfully. "Of course I've got to take the consequences of
      my&#8212;my crime. But I don't care!" she added with
      vivacity. "I'd rather live alone in a ten-story house than
      have missed that Exhibition!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," mused Laura Ann thoughtfully, "it was a beautiful one.
      I'm glad <i>I</i> didn't miss it. When I think of what it
      stood for&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke off suddenly and slipped her hand into Billy's arm.
      Another short silence. Then Laura Ann finished: "All the work
      and patience it stood for, day after day&#8212;girls, when I
      think of that I feel&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know&#8212;all of us know," T.O. hastily interposed.
      "That's about the way we all feel, I guess. No use talking
      about it, though. Billy's broken the Compact and we're under
      oath to drop her."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not till we go back to work," Loraine put in emphatically,
      "and then she can live next door and come in every night to
      tea! There's nothing in the Compact against that, is there?
      Well, then, I invite you, Billy, for the very first tea!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I accept!" laughed Billy. She did not seem at all depressed.
      In her ears rang the pounding refrain of Old '61 marching
      through Georgia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing more was said on this subject. A little picnic had
      been planned for the afternoon, and they went briskly about
      making preparations for it, as soon as they got back to Mrs.
      Camp's little green house. While they worked they discussed
      Amelia.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If she hadn't gone with her mother we'd have taken her to
      the picnic with us," the Talented One said, over her
      egg-beating. "I wonder if Amelia likes picnics?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Don't! You make me feel creepy," Laura Ann laughed. "What
      <i>I</i> wonder is how she'd have looked if she'd ever been
      born. I lay awake one night trying to imagine Amelia."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blue eyes and golden hair," Loraine chimed in dreamily, "and
      a little dimple in her chin."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You needn't any of you lie awake nights imagining. I can
      tell you," the Talented One said. "She has blue eyes, but her
      hair is brown and the dimples are in her cheeks. Her hair
      just waves a little away from the parting&#8212;it is always
      parted. She sits very still, sewing patchwork&#8212;her
      mother told me," added the Talented One quietly. "She said
      she wished she knew how to paint so she could paint Amelia's
      picture. She told me where she'd like to have it
      hung&#8212;here in the dining-room, between the windows.
      Amelia'd always been very real, she said, but the picture
      would make her realer."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did she ever say what kind of dresses Amelia wears?" asked
      Laura Ann without looking up from her stirring.
    </p>
    <p>
      "No, I never asked, but they must be white dresses, I
      think,&#8212;Amelia is such an innocent little thing,"
      laughed T.O. softly. It was odd how they always laughed or
      talked softly when it was about little make-believe Amelia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The picnic was in the woods, in a lovely little spot Loraine
      had discovered in her wanderings. A brook babbled noisily
      through the spot. They spread their lunch at the foot of a
      forest giant and ate it luxuriously to the tune the brook
      sang. It was hard to believe they had ever been toilers in a
      great city.
    </p>
    <p>
      "There never were any public schools," murmured Loraine,
      lying back and gazing into the thick mesh of leaves overhead.
      "Nobody ever said 'Teacher! Teacher!' to me."
    </p>
    <p>
      "There never were any negatives to be 'touched
      up'&#8212;nobody ever had their pictures taken," Laura Ann
      murmured, dreamy, too. "I've always been here beside this
      brook, lying on my back&#8212;what a beautiful world it's
      always been!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Talented One sat rigidly straight. "There have always
      been handkerchiefs," she sighed, "and there always will be. I
      shall have to go back there and sell them. When I look at all
      these leaves, it reminds me&#8212;there are leaves on
      handkerchiefs, straggling round the borders&#8212;ugh!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was foolish talk, perhaps, but it was the place and the
      time for foolish talk. After a little more of it they drifted
      apart, wandering this way and that in a delightful, aimless
      way. So little of their four lives had been aimless or
      especially delightful that they reveled in the sweet
      opportunity. Loraine wandered farthest. She came after awhile
      to a clearing where a small pond glimmered redly with the
      parting rays of the sun. A great boy lounged beside the pond
      dangling a pole. Loraine recognized him as Jane Cotton's Sam.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" she said, "now I've made a noise and scared away your
      fish!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ain't any fish," muttered the boy. He did not turn around.
      The pole slanted further and further, till it lay on the bank
      beside the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh, maybe there are, if you wait long enough&#8212;and
      nobody comes crashing through the bushes! I don't
      suppose&#8212;I mean if you are not going to use it any more
      yourself&#8212;" Loraine looked toward the idle pole. "I
      never fished in my life," she explained. The boy understood
      with remarkable quickness.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You mean you'd like to try it?" he asked, and this time
      turned round. It was not at all a bad face on close
      inspection, Loraine decided. The veil of sullenness had
      lifted a little.

      </center>
    <p>
      "Oh, but I just would! Only if I should have an accident and
      catch anything, whatever would I do! They&#8212;they are
      always cold and clammy, aren't they?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Jane Cotton's Sam laughed outright, and Loraine decided that
      it was a very good face.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll 'tend to all you catch," the boy said. He was busily
      baiting the hook; now he extended the pole to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wiggle it&#8212;up and down a little, like this," he
      directed, "and don't make any more noise than you can help.
      If you feel a bite, let me know."
    </p>
    <p>
      "But I don't see how I can feel a bite unless they bite
      me&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the boy laughed wholesomely. They were getting
      acquainted. The fishing began, and for what seemed to her a
      long time Loraine sat absolutely still, dangling the pole.
      Nothing happened for a discouraging while. Then Loraine
      whispered: "I feel a bite, but it's on my wrist! If it's a
      mosquito I wish you would 'shoo' it off."
    </p>
    <p>
      Another wait. Then a real bite in the right place. In another
      moment Loraine landed a wriggling little fish in the grass.
      She did not squeal nor shudder, but sat regarding it with
      gentle pride.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor little thing! I suppose I ought to put you back, but
      you're my first and only fish, and I've <i>got</i> to carry
      you home for the girls to see. You'll have to forgive me this
      time!" She turned to the boy. "I suppose he ought to be
      dressed, or undressed, or something, before he's fried,
      oughtn't he? I thought I'd like to fry him for breakfast, to
      surprise the girls&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "I'll dress him for you," Jane Cotton's Sam said eagerly,
      "and bring him over in the morning in plenty o' time."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thank you," Loraine said heartily. "Now you'll have to let
      me do something for you. 'Turn about is fair play.' Couldn't
      I&#8212;" She hesitated, looking out over the still reddened
      water rather than at the boy's face. "Couldn't I help you in
      some way with your studies? That's my business, you know. It
      would really be doing me a kindness, for I may get all out of
      practice unless I teach somebody something!" Had Loraine,
      too, forgotten the Compact on the screen door?
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy fidgeted, then burst out angrily: "I s'pose they've
      all been telling you I failed up in my exams? They have,
      haven't they? You <i>knew</i> it, didn't you?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes," Loraine answered quietly. "But I've heard a good many
      worse things in my life. I've heard of boys that smoked and
      drank and&#8212;and <i>stole</i>. What does missing a few
      examinations amount to beside things like those?" But the boy
      did not seem to have been listening to anything except his
      own angry thoughts. All his sun-browned young face was
      flooded with red; he had run his fingers through his hair
      till it stood up fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      "They needn't trouble themselves 'bout me, nor you needn't,
      nor anybody needn't!" he declaimed loudly. "Anybody'd think
      they were saints themselves!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "And <i>I</i> was a saint and everybody was saints!" laughed
      Loraine softly. But Jane Cotton's Sam did not laugh. He went
      striding away into the woods, his head flung up high. Loraine
      and the little dead fish were left behind. Oddly the girl was
      not thinking of the boy's rudeness in return for her kind
      offer of help, but of the flash of spirit in his eyes. It
      augured well for him, she was thinking, for spirit was
      spirit, although "gone wrong." In the right place, it should
      spur him on to a second attempt to get into college. What if
      she were to persist in her offer&#8212;were to work with him,
      urge him to work with her?
    </p>
    <p>
      But he had chosen to spurn her advances. She shook her head
      sadly. On his own head be it. She turned her attention to the
      little dead fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      "You poor dear, you look so dead and forlorn&#8212;what am I
      going to do with you? Someway you've got to go home with me
      and be fried." She took him up gingerly, but dropped him
      again&#8212;he was so slippery and damp! Wrap him in her
      handkerchief? But she had no pocket and she could never,
      never carry him in her sleeve which she had adopted as a
      pocket. So then she must leave him, must she? Poor little
      useless sacrifice!
    </p>
    <p>
      Back at the picnic spot the girls were waiting for her. They
      went home in the late, sweet twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      A letter was tucked under the screen door where some friendly
      neighbor had left it. "Miss Thomasia O. Brown," Billy read
      aloud, and waved the letter in triumph, for the secret was
      out. The 'T' in T.O. stood for Thomasia!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well?" bristled the Talented One, "it had to stand for
      something, didn't it? It's awful, I know, but <i>I'm</i> not
      to blame&#8212;I didn't name myself, did I? I wish people
      could," she added with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Is it for a <i>Thomas?</i>" questioned Laura Ann curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomasia nodded: "There was always a Thomas in the family
      until they got to me. They did the best they could to make me
      one." She was opening the letter with careful precision.
      "Why, of course, it's from Mrs. Camp!" she cried delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear, I hope you are well and your friends have come, and
      Jane Cotton's Sam has not forgotten to paint the pump. I
      arrived here safely after a very long journey&#8212;my dear,
      I never dreamed the world was so big! This part of it is well
      enough, but give me Placid Pond! Now I am going to tell you
      something, and you may laugh all you're a mind to&#8212;I
      sha'n't hear! What I'm going to tell is, <i>Amelia came</i>,
      too. After I'd got good and settled down on the cars I looked
      up and knew she was sitting right opposite, on the seat I'd
      turned over. She seemed <i>there</i>&#8212;and you may laugh,
      my dear. I laughed, I was so pleased to have Amelia along.
      John doesn't know she came&#8212;Amelia never makes a mite of
      trouble! But everywhere I go she goes, my dear. I shouldn't
      tell you if I didn't feel you'd understand. If he hasn't
      painted it yet, the blue paint is on a shelf in the
      woodhouse, and you can paint it. I'm afraid Jane Cotton's Sam
      won't ever amount to much. Poor Jane!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomasia read the letter aloud, and at this point Loraine
      interposed warmly: "Jane Cotton's Sam is abused! It's a shame
      everybody groans over him&#8212;<i>I</i> like him. If there
      isn't a lot of good in him, then I don't know how to read
      human nature, that's all."
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning very early someone knocked at the kitchen
      door. It was Laura Ann's turn to make the fire, and she
      answered the knock. Jane Cotton's Sam stood on the steps
      outside. He had a mysterious little package in his hand. He
      looked up eagerly, but it was evident from the disappointed
      look on his face that Laura Ann was the wrong girl. And he
      did not know the right one's name!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning!" nodded Laura Ann, sublimely unconscious of
      the soot-patch over her nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-morning. I'd like to see&#8212;I've brought something
      for the one that teaches school."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Loraine? But she isn't up yet&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I am up, too," called a voice overhead, "but I won't be
      long! I'll be <i>down</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a little fish, dressed and ready to fry, that was in
      the tiny bundle. The boy extended it blushingly. Then his
      eyes lifted to Loraine's in frank petition for pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I was mighty rude," he said. "I went back to the pond to say
      so, but you were gone. I beg your pardon."
    </p>
    <p>
      She liked the tone of his voice and his good red blushes.
      "That's all right," she nodded reassuringly. But he did not
      go away. There was something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      "If&#8212;you know what you said? If you'd offer
      <i>again</i>&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      Loraine glanced over her shoulder. Laura Ann was rattling
      stove-lids at the other end of the kitchen. "I offer
      <i>now</i>," Loraine said in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then I accept." The boy's voice was eager. "I'll study like
      everything! I thought about it in the night&#8212;I thought
      I'd like to surprise my mother. If I could get into college
      next year&#8212;" His eyes shone. "Oh I say, I'd do 'most
      anything for that!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The little plan was hurriedly made, in low tones, there on
      Emmeline Camp's little doorsteps. The boy was to take his
      books to the pond where Loraine had caught her fish. He was
      to study there alone for a time every day, and in the
      afternoon she was to stroll that way and go over the work
      with him and set him right in all the wrong places.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was in Latin and mathematics I failed up," Jane Cotton's
      Sam explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's Latin and mathematics we'll tackle!" softly laughed
      Loraine. "You wait&#8212;you see&#8212;you <i>grind!</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      He strode away, whistling, and the tune was full of courage
      and determination. Loraine smiled as she listened. She stood
      a moment, then opened the screen door and went in. The
      "Compact" swung and tilted with the jolt of her energetic
      movements. She adjusted it with a queer little smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      For summer days on summer days the covert, earnest lessons
      went on beside the bit of sunny water. Teacher and pupil
      pored intently over the problems and difficult passages, and
      steadily the pupil's courage grew. The old sullen look had
      vanished&#8212;Jane Cotton's Sam put on manliness and a
      splendid swing to his shoulders. In her heart Loraine
      exulted. What if she were disobeying the Compact&#8212;death
      to the Wicked Compact!
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura Ann suspected, but for reasons of her own kept her own
      counsel. She had begun to suspect, when Jane Cotton's Sam
      brought the little fish. At that time the "reasons of her
      own" had begun to influence her and she had omitted to
      mention to Billy and T.O. that the boy had stood on the
      doorsteps in earnest conversation with Loraine. Mentioning it
      to Billy might not, indeed, have mattered, since Billy was
      already an "outsider." But Loraine might not want T.O. to
      know, anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was significant that Laura Ann, in going in and out, now
      chose to ignore the gayly-illuminated placard that swung on
      the door&#8212;that she herself had adorned and hung there.
      But she did not go in and out as much now; for whole mornings
      she slipped away to a little attic room upstairs and busied
      herself alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was getting grievously near the time to go back to the
      great city again. Emmeline Camp was coming back then.
    </p>
    <p>
      All but T.O. mourned audibly the rapidly lessening days, but
      T.O. made no useless laments. One day she surprised them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Girls, I <i>want</i> to go back!" she announced. "I shall be
      ready when it's time&#8212;now anybody can say what anybody
      pleases. Scoff at me&#8212;do. I expect it! But I'm getting
      homesick to see a street-car and a&#8212;a policeman! It's
      lovely and peaceful here, but I've had my fill of it
      now&#8212;I want to go home and bump into crowds and hear
      big, stirry noises. It's different with you girls&#8212;you
      weren't born in the city; you didn't play with street-cars
      and policemen and get sung to sleep by the noises! I was
      tired&#8212;tired&#8212;and now I'm rested. I've had a
      perfectly beautiful time, but I shall be ready to go back.
      Honestly, girls, it would break my heart not to!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so much like T.O., Billy said, to keep all her
      feelings to herself and then suddenly spring them on people
      like that, and take people's breath away. Billy did not keep
      things to herself.

      Jane Cotton came up the kitchen path one day when all but
      Loraine were sitting on the doorsteps&#8212;Loraine had
      strolled nonchalantly down the street as her afternoon habit
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, I've found out!" announced Jane Cotton. She was
      beaming; her sallow face was oddly cleared and
      lighted&#8212;her lips trembled with eagerness to deliver her
      news. "I've <i>found out</i>! Where's the rest o' you?" She
      counted them over. "It's the rest o' you I want&#8212;well,
      you tell her I've found out. Tell her I hardly slept a wink
      last night, I was so happy! Tell her I <i>bless</i> her, and
      I know the Lord will. They didn't want me to know yet but I
      couldn't help finding out. And they won't mind when they know
      how happy it's made me&#8212;oh, I ain't afraid but he'll
      pass this time! I know he will&#8212;I know it! You tell her
      she's saved my boy." And without further delay the slender
      figure turned and walked jubilantly down the path. It was as
      if she marched to the melody of the joy in her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other silently, then at the Wicked
      Compact behind them. There did not seem any explanation
      needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Another one dropped," murmured T.O. sighingly. But Laura Ann
      said nothing.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Laura Ann stole quietly away and went upstairs to the little
      attic room. Close by the window was a rough little easel
      arrangement with a picture on it. Laura Ann stood regarding
      it thoughtfully. "I wonder"&#8212;she smiled at the whimsy of
      the thought&#8212;"I wonder if it looks like Amelia," she
      murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a wonderful picture. No committee would have hung
      it on a "line." There were rather glaring errors in it of
      draughtsmanship and coloring. But the face of the girl in it
      was appealingly sweet&#8212;brown hair, blue eyes, little
      round chin. Laura Ann had not dared to put in the dimples.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dimples need a master," she said, "besides, they only show
      when you smile, and I don't believe Amelia smiles very
      often!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat down and took up a brush. The picture was nearly
      done, but she found touches to be added here and there. There
      might be a stray lock&#8212;there, like that. And a little
      bit more shade under the chin, and the wistful droop of the
      mouth relieved, oh, a very little bit! Amelia looked so
      serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Poor little thing! Well, it's a serious matter to be a
      dream-child, with not an ounce of good red blood in your
      veins."
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura Ann meant to slip back after they had started for the
      station, on the last day, and hang the picture in the little
      sunny dining-room. She did not want the girls to know there
      was a picture. But still&#8212;a new thought had begun to
      obtrude itself unwelcomely. Was painting Amelia's portrait a
      breach, too, of the Compact? She had undertaken it as a
      little "offering" to Mrs. Camp, to show her own individual
      gratitude for her own share of the dear little green cottage
      all these beautiful weeks&#8212;T.O. had said Mrs. Camp had
      longed for a picture. But the fact that it had taken many
      patient hours of work "unto others," was not to be
      overlooked. If it had broken the rules of the Wicked Compact,
      and she went back to the B-Hive without letting the girls
      know of it&#8212;oh, hum! of course that would be another
      "wicked compact"! She would have to let them know&#8212;and
      she didn't want to let them know&#8212;oh, dear!
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Laura Ann dropped her paints and gave herself up to
      laughter. She had remembered that only T.O.&#8212;Thomasia
      O.&#8212;would be left now in the B-Hive! For all the rest
      had broken the Compact. Thomasia O., living all alone in the
      dear, shabby little rooms, presented a funny picture, for of
      them all she was least fitted to live alone. Even Billy could
      do better.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The rest of us will live together," laughed Laura Ann.
      "There's nothing to prevent that, if we live outside the old
      B-Hive. We'll start a new B-Hive! Poor Thomasia O.!"
    </p>
    <p>
      They would miss T.O. very much indeed&#8212;well, they could
      invite her in to tea and keep her all night! In spite of the
      wicked old Compact, they would keep together. "And we'll
      never," vowed Laura Ann for them all, "sign any more
      nefarious bonds!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She hung the picture of Amelia on the wall when they were all
      away, and then went away herself. She stayed away until
      nearly dark. Thomasia O. went to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I knew it all the time," she said quietly, without preface
      of any kind. "It's a perfect likeness."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You knew it?" said Laura Ann.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, I was prowling 'round one day, to see what attics were
      like, and I found Amelia. Only her hair and her eyes, then,
      but I knew her. I'm so glad poor Mrs. Camp will have that
      picture to help her bear her troubles!"
    </p><a name="image-6"><!-- Image 6 --></a>

      <img src="images/comp-im6.png" height="581" width="400" alt=
      "THE PICTURE WAS NEARLY DONE.">
    </center>
    <p>
      "Poor"&#8212;"troubles." This was all enigma to Laura Ann.
      But she wisely waited to be enlightened. She had divined the
      moment she saw T.O. that the girl was unusually disturbed.
      This was true.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've had two letters&#8212;the first one came three weeks
      ago from her brother. I didn't want to spoil your good time,
      telling sad things, so I kept it to myself&#8212;Laura Ann,
      that woman <i>mothered</i> me!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Laura Ann stood still. "Do you mean Mrs. Camp? Is
      she&#8212;dead?" But the other did not seem to hear. She ran
      on in a low, troubled voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      "She bathed my ankle, and said 'My dear,' and waited on me,
      when she'd never set eyes on me in her life before. How did
      she know but that I was an&#8212;an <i>impostor</i>? And she
      let us have her dear little house to live in&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Yes, yes&#8212;oh, yes, she let <i>me</i> live in it!" Laura
      Ann interposed. "You ought to have told us she was dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      "She isn't dead. She's fallen downstairs and broken her hip.
      The doctor says it's so bad she won't ever walk again without
      crutches, her brother wrote. He said he wanted her to stay
      and live with him, but she wouldn't listen to it. She wanted
      to come home as soon as she possibly could. So she's
      coming&#8212;he's coming with her, to 'start' her."
    </p>
    <p>
      T.O. fingered a letter in her hand in a nervous, undecided
      way, as if she were half inclined to read it to the other
      girl. It was not Emmeline Camp's brother's letter. It had
      come ten days ago, and she herself knew it by heart. How
      many, many times she had read it! She had cried over the
      wistful cry in it, and over Amelia's death&#8212;for the
      letter said that Amelia was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear," it said, "I've lost Amelia&#8212;you'd think she
      would have stood by her mother in her trouble, wouldn't you?
      But she hasn't been near me since. It seems
      queer&#8212;perhaps after people break their hips they can't
      'feel' anything else but their hips! Perhaps it breaks their
      imaginations. Anyway, Amelia's dead, my dear. Sometimes I
      think mebbe I'd ought to be, too&#8212;a lone little woman
      like me, without a chick or a child. Old women with children
      can afford to tumble downstairs, but not my kind of old
      women. John is real good. He wants me to stay here, but I
      can't&#8212;I can't, I can't, my dear! I've got to be where I
      can limp out to the old pump and the gate and the orchard, on
      my crutches&#8212;I've got to see the old hills I was born
      in, and Old '61 marching past the house, and the old
      neighbors&#8212;I've got to die at <i>home</i>, my dear. So
      John can't keep me. I wish I was going to find you there. I
      keep thinking how beautiful it would be. You'd be out to the
      gate waiting, the way people's daughters wait for them. And
      mebbe you'd have the kettle all hot and we'd have a cup of
      tea together just as if I was the mother and you
      was&#8212;Amelia! All the way home I should be thinking about
      your being there. It's queer, isn't it, you went limping in
      that gate first, and now it's me? A good many things are
      queer, and some are kind of desolate. I've decided, my dear,
      that daughters have to be the kind that are born, to stay by
      a body in trouble. They have to be made of flesh and blood,
      my dear&#8212;and Amelia wasn't!
    </p>
    <p>
      "I've written this a little to a time, laying on my back.
      Mebbe you won't ever read it. Mebbe I won't ever see you
      again, but you will remember, my dear, that I've loved you
      ever since I took off your stocking and saw your poor,
      sprained ankle. If the Lord would perform a miracle for me,
      I'd ask for it to be the bringing of Amelia to life and
      finding her you."
    </p>
    <p>
      T.O. did not show the letter to Laura Ann. She put it in her
      pocket again, and they walked home slowly, talking of Mrs.
      Camp's sad accident. At the supper table it was voted that
      they all write a joint letter of sympathy to her, and
      express, at the same time, their united and separate thanks
      for her kindness to them in lending them her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loraine wrote the letter, Laura Ann copied it, they all
      signed it. Into cold pen-and-ink words they tried to diffuse
      warmth and gratitude and sympathy, but the result was not
      very satisfying, as such results rarely are. Still, it was
      all they could do. Billy and Laura Ann went off to mail it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Do you begin to feel lonesome?" laughed Loraine softly, as
      she and T.O. sat on the steps in the dark. "Thinking of being
      left all alone in the Hive, I mean? The rest of us begin to
      feel lonesome, thinking of being left out! We had a grist of
      good times all together, didn't we? Remember the little
      'treats' when you always brought home olives, and Billy sage
      cheese? Laura Ann used to change about&#8212;sometimes
      eclairs, sometimes sauerkraut! Always sardines for me. Oh,
      <i>do</i> you remember the treat with a capital 'T,' when we
      had ice cream and angel cake? And Billy wanted to divide the
      hole so as not to waste anything&#8212;there, I don't believe
      you've heard a word I said!"
    </p>
    <p>
      She had not, for she was not there. Loraine put out her hand
      in the darkness, but could not find her. She had slipped away
      unceremoniously.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was down in the road, walking fast and hard. The battle
      was on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I thought I had it all decided&#8212;I <i>did</i> have! Why
      do I have to decide it over again?" she was saying stormily
      to herself. "I said I'd do it, and I'm going to do
      it&#8212;what am I down here fighting in the dark for?" But
      still she fought on.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was so still about her, and with all her girl's heart she
      longed for noise again&#8212;car-bells and rattling wheels
      and din of men's voices. There were such wide spaces all
      about, and she longed for narrow spaces&#8212;for rows on
      rows of houses and people coming and going. It was the
      city-blood in her asserting itself. She had had her breath of
      space and freedom and green, growing things, and exulted in
      it while it lasted. Now she pined for her native streets. But
      all the sympathy and gratitude in her went out to the little
      old woman who was coming home to a lonely home&#8212;whose
      one dream-child was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one had ever really needed her before&#8212;to be needed
      appealed to her strongly. And in the short time between her
      own coming to Placid Pond and the coming of the other girls,
      a bond of real affection had been established between Mrs.
      Camp and herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      But hadn't she been over all this before? Long ago she had
      decided what to do. Now, suddenly, she wheeled in the dark
      road and went hurrying in the other direction. She would go
      back to Loraine on the doorstep, and laugh and talk. She had
      decided "for good."
    </p>
    <p>
      The stars came trooping out, and she lifted her face to them
      with a new sense of peace. They were such friendly, twinkling
      little stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      T.O. was humming a lilty little tune when she came up the
      path in the starlight and joined Loraine again on the
      doorstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other two girls were coming slowly back from the little
      country post office, both to hurry and have the pleasant walk
      over. Billy had been saying nice things about the portrait of
      Amelia they had found hanging on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It's a dear!" she said heartily. "I wish I could make a
      picture like that."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You've made one a thousand times better!" cried Laura Ann.
      "I saw it this afternoon."
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Me</i>&#8212;make a picture?" Billy's voice was
      incredulous. "I couldn't draw my breath straight!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a beautiful one. I stood still and looked at it. Your
      background was fine, dear&#8212;woods banked against a late
      afternoon sky, with bits of red light straggling through the
      branches, a little box of a house in the foreground, with
      patches of new shingles on the 'cover'; a crooked little
      front path, a funny little well, a little rosebush all a
      flame of color&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mercy!" Billy's little triangle of a face put on alarm. Was
      Laura Ann losing her mind?
    </p>
    <p>
      "But that&#8212;all that&#8212;was only the setting. The
      heart of the picture, dear, was an old man marching up and
      down the path&#8212;did I say it was a moving picture? He was
      whistling a tune in a wheezy way, and keeping step to it
      grandly. Once he seemed to lose a few notes; then he went
      into a little box of a house, and I heard an organ&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "Oh!" breathed Billy, assured of the other's sanity, "you
      mean Old '61 practicing! That's the way he does&#8212;he's
      learning to march through Georgia without the organ, but he
      misses a step or two sometimes. <i>That</i> was the picture,
      was it?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "It was a beautiful one," Laura Ann said softly. "You needn't
      tell me you can't paint, Billy! That's the kind of pictures
      we shall find hanging in the Great Picture Gallery."
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on for a little in silence, with only the piping
      chorus of the little night creatures in their ears. The
      sweet, cool damp was in their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Here we are at Jane Cotton's Sam's," Billy whispered by and
      by, to break the spell. She could not have told why she
      whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So we are. Billy, look, he's studying like a trooper! That
      boy is going to walk straight into college in September!
      Let's go straight home and hug Loraine&#8212;come on! Take
      hold of my hand, and we'll run."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Wait&#8212;wait! Look, there's another of your pictures,
      Laura Ann!" Billy's lips were close to the other's ear; Billy
      was pointing. Into the little lighted room where Jane
      Cotton's Sam sat poring over a book, had come another figure.
      As they looked, it stopped beside the boy and bent over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      "That's just the setting&#8212;all that," Laura Ann murmured.
      "The heart of the picture is her face, Billy!" For Jane
      Cotton's face was radiant.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <p>
      The day at last came for their return to the city and to the
      work they were so much better able to do. The little,
      green-painted house was in spotless order to leave behind. As
      Mrs. Camp was to come the following day, they had filled the
      little pantry with food&#8212;not remarkably light cake or
      bread, not especially flaky piecrust, but everything flavored
      with sympathy and gratitude and good will.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go on, all of you; I'll catch up," Billy said, as they stood
      on the steps with the door locked behind them. "When you get
      out of sight I'm going to kiss the house good-by!"
    </p>
    <p>
      "T.O. had better stay behind with you, to kiss the pump!"
      Loraine said. "Or we'll all stay&#8212;I guess we can all
      find something to kiss."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Did anybody think to take down the Wicked Compact?" demanded
      Laura Ann suddenly. "It would be awful to leave that behind."
    </p>
    <p>
      They were at the gate. T.O. stopped suddenly, pointing. What
      they saw was a tiny, tiny mound, rounded symmetrically.
      "There it lies&#8212;I buried it," T.O. said briefly, but
      added, "And let no one keep its grave green!" They looked at
      her a little curiously. Perhaps they were thinking that it
      might have been appropriate for her to take it home with her
      and hang it on the wall to keep her company in the lonely
      little B-Hive. But they only laughed and tramped on
      cheerfully to the station. They were a little late, and had
      to run the last of the way. The train was already in, and
      they scrambled aboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well, here we are leaving Eldorado!" sighed breathlessly
      Loraine.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And all of us heart-broken but T.O.&#8212;girls, where's
      T.O.?"
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not there. The train was getting under way. In a
      flurry they huddled to the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Good-by! Good-by!" shouted a gay voice from the platform. A
      little white envelope flew in at one of the open windows.
      T.O., quite calm and unexcited, stood out there waving to
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "What in the world!" ejaculated Laura Ann, then stopped. For
      she alone could see a little ray of light. "Read the letter,"
      she said more quietly. "The letter will tell us."
    </p>
    <p>
      They all read it together, their heads bunched closely.

      "Dear girls, I'm going to stay. I never was needed before,
      but I guess I am now. And maybe you'll think it's funny, but
      I'm <i>wanted</i>! An imaginary daughter can't wait on a poor
      little cripple&#8212;it takes the flesh-and-blood kind. I
      found out she wanted me, and so I'm going to stay. It would
      have been lonesome, anyway, all alone in the Hive! I bequeath
      all my rights to you&#8212;"
    </p>
    <p>
      "As if she had any now, any more than the rest of us!"
      muttered Billy fiercely, her eyes full of tears.

    <p>
      "Sometimes when you're going and coming, some o' you listen
      to the car-wires sing, for me, and the wheels rattle," the
      letter went on. "Bump into somebody sometime for me! Good-by.
      You're all of you dears.

      "Amelia."

      At the signature they choked a little, and looked away at the
      flying landscape without seeing it at all. Laura Ann saw
      another picture&#8212;a girl waiting at a little gate. Woods
      and dusty road and humble little homes for background, and an
      old stage rattling into view in the foreground. She saw it
      stop&#8212;in the picture&#8212;and a helpless little old
      figure be taken out. She saw the girl at the gate spring
      forward and hold out her hands. But the heart of the picture
      was the face of the little old woman on crutches. It was
      another picture for the Grand Gallery.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
